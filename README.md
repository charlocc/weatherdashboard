## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

This weather dashboard allows user to input cities and see up-to-date weather and forecast for the upcoming five days.
When the user searches for a city, they are then presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
The user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
```
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
```
Future weather conditions for that city are also displayed, with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
Clicking on a city in the search history will re-present current and future conditions for that city.
